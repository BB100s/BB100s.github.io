Since the beginning of my high school and even part of my middle school years, I had my eyes set on being a Computer Science major. I had this whole goal of working for the FBI or some government/private company and spend my days coding away. When I got to UH in Fall 2019 I was a CS major, but it wasn't what I expected. A lot of the classes were first off in a language I never learned before. My AP Comp Sci class in high school taught C++ while the ICS 101 class taught with Java. Learning a new language was part of the problem, but the other part was the way the class was formatted, they expected you to know Java already. So going through that class I had to not only try and do all the assignments and projects but also learn the language along the way. I had to take this class again in the spring before finally passing, which this also repeated for 201 in my sophomore year. Thats when I went to one of my advisors to ask for help because I was not having fun in the class and also wasn't learning much. That is when she reccomended to me the MIS major. She told me roughly what the major was about and that it was not too far off of a CS major which would make it a little easier and hopefully more fun for me. So far it has been a lot easier then when I was a CS major and I am enjoying it so far.
